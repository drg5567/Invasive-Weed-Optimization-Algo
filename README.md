## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) algorithm with Differential Evolution (DE) for optimization problems. The IWO algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the behavior of invasive weeds. The algorithm is designed to find the optimal solution to a given optimization problem by simulating the growth and spread of invasive weeds in a search space. The DE algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm that is used to evolve a population of candidate solutions to find the optimal solution to a given problem. By combining the IWO and DE algorithms, we aim to improve the performance of the IWO algorithm and enhance its ability to find the optimal solution to a given optimization problem.

This project as such serves as a reproducibility study to the paper "Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm Based on Differential Evolution 
Operators to Solve Bin Packing Problem" by Li, Wang, and Yang.

This project is also extended to the Knapsack problem and demonstrates promising results.

## How to Run
To run the code, make sure you have Python 3+, NumPy, and Matplotlib installed. Then, simply run:
```
python iwo_de_main.py
```
This will run all experiments and comparisons sequentially followed by the plotting each of the results.
